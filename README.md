This repository grants a complete control of the robotic arm KUKA iiwa14 R820. Both a joint and a position control are possible, through either a simulation, a hardware robot, or both of them. The repository is also useful to control the position of a magnetic capsule in a maze, thanks to a magnet positioned at the end-effector of the robot. 

However, you will need to clone other packages to make the repository work, and pasting them in the corresponding folders of the repository. 
Here is the list of the links of those folders : 
gz_ros2_control : https://github.com/ros-controls/gz_ros2_control.git
ros_gz package
fri :https://github.com/lbr-stack/fri.git
lbr_fri_idl:https://github.com/lbr-stack/lbr_fri_idl.git
lbr_fri_ros2_stack:https://github.com/lbr-stack/lbr_fri_ros2_stack.git
